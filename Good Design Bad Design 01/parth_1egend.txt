Changes and Improvements: 

- First Page

1. Login with OTP checkbox was unnecessary so removed it. We already have a button for that at end of the page.
2. Improved the login setup by giving each element proper space and removing the tilted design, instead added shadow effect to have a protruding effect of the login part.
3. Improved the more apps section by keeping the apps in a more organized hexagonal fashion.
4. Added protruding effect at places to highlight that part above rom the background to give good look to the UI.

- Second Page

1. No need to give time at the top of the page as the user will have time on his or her phone. It cluters our header.
2. No need to give different days on the side when already giving them a calender.
3. Same font format in the checkbox list.
4. Convert information section into proper links.
5. Show recent 3 searches and give option to check previous history.

- These changes reduces the clutter on the screen thus making the UI more feasable to use. 
- Removing unncessary buttons and information and giving them separately helps user easily get to where he wants to go.
- Proper looks which is simple makes the app accessible to more users.
- Presenting the data properly without unwanted designs is necessary for making an app user friendly.
